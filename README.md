# String Calculator TDD Kata

## Tips

- Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to one and two numbers.
- Remember to solve problems in a simple manner so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about.
- Remember to refactor after each passing test.

## Steps

1. Create a simple String calculator with a method signature like this:


- **Input:** a string of comma-separated numbers  
- **Output:** an integer, sum of the numbers

**Examples:**  
- Input: `""`, Output: `0`  
- Input: `"1"`, Output: `1`  
- Input: `"1,5"`, Output: `6`

2. Allow the `add` method to handle any amount of numbers.

3. Allow the `add` method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).  
Example: `"1\n2,3"` should return `6`

4. Support different delimiters:  
To change the delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this:  
`"//[delimiter]\n[numbersâ€¦]"`.  
For example, `"//;\n1;2"` where the delimiter is `";"` should return `3`.

5. Calling `add` with a negative number will throw an exception:  
`"negative numbers not allowed <negative_number>"`.

- If there are multiple negative numbers, show all of them in the exception message, separated.
